# Planning

This directory contains **short-term, task-related planning documents** that are not version controlled.

## Purpose

- **Execution plans** - Step-by-step implementation plans for features
- **Task breakdowns** - Detailed task lists and checklists
- **Spike notes** - Research notes, proof-of-concept findings
- **Scratch work** - Brainstorming, diagrams, temporary notes
- **WIP documents** - Work-in-progress documentation before finalization

## Gitignore Status

⚠️ **This directory is gitignored** (except for this README)

All files added to `plan/` will be ignored by git. This allows you to:

- Keep personal notes without cluttering the repository
- Store temporary planning documents locally
- Iterate on ideas without committing incomplete work

## Guidelines

- Use this for **temporary** or **personal** planning materials
- Once planning is finalized, move relevant documentation to `docs/`
- Clean up old plans periodically to avoid clutter
