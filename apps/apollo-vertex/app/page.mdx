# Introduction

**Apollo Vertex** is the design system for UiPath Vertical Solutions - customizable, industry-specific automation solutions built on the UiPath platform.

## Overview

The `@uipath/vs-core` package provides everything you need to build data-driven UiPath solutions:

- **UiPath SDK Integration**: Simplified APIs for working with UiPath Data Service entities and process executions
- **React Context Provider**: `SolutionProvider` for easy SDK initialization and data access
- **TanStack Query Collections**: Ready-to-use data collections with built-in caching and reactivity
- **TypeScript Types**: Full type safety for entities, processes, and configurations

## Getting Started

To create a new vertical solution, you have two options:

**Option 1: Install the UI CLI + plugins (Recommended)**

```bash
npm install @uipath/ui-cli @uipath/ui-cli-vss @uipath/ui-cli-deploy
```

After installing, you can run commands via `ui-cli`.

### `@uipath/ui-cli-vss` commands

VSS plugin for Vertical Solution Templates.

Also supports flags, for more info ui-cli vss --help or ui-cli vss [command] --help.

Plugin docs: https://github.com/UiPath/ui-cli/tree/master/packages/vss

- **Initialize a new VSS project**

```bash
ui-cli vss init [path]
```

- **Add an entity**

```bash
ui-cli vss add entity
```

- **Add a process**

```bash
ui-cli vss add process
```

- **Sync entities**

```bash
ui-cli vss sync
```

### `@uipath/ui-cli-deploy` commands

Deployment automation plugin for building, packaging, and publishing UiPath apps.

Also supports flags, for more info ui-cli deploy --help or ui-cli deploy [command] --help.

Plugin docs: https://github.com/UiPath/ui-cli/tree/master/packages/deploy

- **Initialize deployment configuration**

```bash
ui-cli deploy init
```

- **Deploy your app**

```bash
ui-cli deploy run
```

**Option 2: Fork the Template**

Start with the [Vertical Solution Template](https://github.com/UiPath/vertical-solutions-template) for a pre-configured project structure.

Both options give you a ready-to-use project with `@uipath/vs-core` already installed and configured.

## Next Steps

After using the template or CLI, your project is pre-configured with everything you need. See the [Data Querying](/data-querying/loading-data) section to learn how to load and mutate data using the `useSolution` hook.
