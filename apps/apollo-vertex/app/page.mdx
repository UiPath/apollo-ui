# Introduction

**Apollo Vertex** is the design system for UiPath Vertical Solutions - customizable, industry-specific automation solutions built on the UiPath platform.

## Overview

The `@uipath/vs-core` package provides everything you need to build data-driven UiPath solutions:

- **UiPath SDK Integration**: Simplified APIs for working with UiPath Data Service entities and process executions
- **React Context Provider**: `SolutionProvider` for easy SDK initialization and data access
- **TanStack Query Collections**: Ready-to-use data collections with built-in caching and reactivity
- **Vite Plugin**: Build-time tooling for type generation and configuration
- **TypeScript Types**: Full type safety for entities, processes, and configurations

## Getting Started

To create a new vertical solution, you have two options:

**Option 1: Install the UI CLI + plugins (Recommended)**

```bash
npm install @uipath/ui-cli @uipath/ui-cli-vss @uipath/ui-cli-deploy
```

After installing, you can run commands via `ui-cli`.

### `@uipath/ui-cli-vss` commands

VSS plugin for Vertical Solution Templates.

Also supports flags, for more info ui-cli vss --help or ui-cli vss [command] --help.

Plugin docs: https://github.com/UiPath/ui-cli/tree/master/packages/vss

- **Initialize a new VSS project**

```bash
ui-cli vss init [path]
```

- **Add an entity**

```bash
ui-cli vss add entity
```

- **Add a process**

```bash
ui-cli vss add process
```

- **Sync entities**

```bash
ui-cli vss sync
```

### `@uipath/ui-cli-deploy` commands

Deployment automation plugin for building, packaging, and publishing UiPath apps.

Also supports flags, for more info ui-cli deploy --help or ui-cli deploy [command] --help.

Plugin docs: https://github.com/UiPath/ui-cli/tree/master/packages/deploy

- **Initialize deployment configuration**

```bash
ui-cli deploy init
```

- **Deploy your app**

```bash
ui-cli deploy run
```

**Option 2: Fork the Template**

Start with the [Vertical Solution Template](https://github.com/UiPath/vertical-solutions-template) for a pre-configured project structure.

Both options give you a ready-to-use project with `@uipath/vs-core` already installed and configured.

## How It Works

After using the template or CLI, your project is pre-configured with everything you need. Here's how to use it:

### Access Data with useSolution Hook

Use the `useSolution` hook to access your data collections and query them with TanStack Query:

```tsx
import { useSolution } from '@uipath/vs-core';
import { useLiveQuery, eq } from '@tanstack/react-db';

function InvoicesList() {
  const { api } = useSolution();

  // Query all invoices
  const { data: invoices, isLoading } = useLiveQuery(q =>
    q.from({ invoices: api.collections.Invoices })
  );

  // Query invoices with process data joined
  const { data: result } = useLiveQuery(q => {
    return q.from({ entities: api.collections.Invoices })
      .join(
        { processes: api.collections.processes.all },
        ({ entities, processes }) =>
          eq(entities.InternalInstanceId, processes?.instanceId),
        "inner"
      )
      .select(({ entities, processes }) => ({
        ...entities,
        ...processes,
      }));
  });

  // Query a single invoice by ID
  const { data: [invoice] } = useLiveQuery(q =>
    q.from({ invoices: api.collections.Invoices })
     .where(({ invoices }) => eq(invoices.Id, invoiceId))
  );

  return <div>{/* Render your data */}</div>;
}
```

That's it! The `useSolution` hook gives you access to all your UiPath data through reactive TanStack Query collections.

### Example (real app)

For a concrete example of a “solutions hook” pattern in a Vertical Solution app, see `useTask.tsx` from the Invoice Processing solution:

https://github.com/UiPath/vertical-solution-invoice-processing/blob/b071b09161c701e3b6ad0754f53682ca142170ff/client/src/hooks/useTask.tsx

## What Gets Auto-Generated

The Vite plugin (`@uipath/vs-core/vite`) automatically generates the `vss.gen.ts` file based on your UiPath Data Service schema. This file contains:

- Entity definitions with all fields and types
- Process definitions with their IDs and folder keys
- Full TypeScript types for type-safe data access

You never need to manually write entity or process configurations - just connect to your UiPath environment and the plugin handles the rest.
